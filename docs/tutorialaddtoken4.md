In the next step, you have to approve spending from your wallet. 

Note: An alternative to setting approval using Etherscan, as explained below, is via the user friendly interface [Mesa](https://mesa.eth.link), the first dapp built on Gnosis Protocol. To perform this step on Mesa, head to the 'Balances' tab and click 'enable OWL' and confirm with your web3 provider (no need to deposit). 

To continue with this step using Etherscan:

1. Go to https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a5f9352af8af974bfc03399e3767df6370d82e4#writeContract.

2. Connect to your web3 wallet provider.

3. Use the “approve” functionality: 

    a. Spender is the Gnosis Protocol contract: <span style="color:#DB3A3D">0x6f400810b62df8e13fded51be75ff5393eaa841f</span>.

    b. Value is the amount the contract is allowed to spend with 18 decimals. You will need to give a minimal allowance of 10 OWL (<span style="color:#DB3A3D">10000000000000000000</span>).

    c. Click write and approve the transaction via your wallet provider.
