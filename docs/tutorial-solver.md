title: Run a Solver
sidebar_label: Overview
---

This tutorial will cover how to run the open solver for Gnosis Protocol. Before you get started, make sure youâ€™ve familiarized yourself with the [Gnosis Protocol Introduction](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol/docs/introduction1/), especially the section on what "solvers" are in the context of Gnosis Protocol.

## Installing Driver Tools

Clone the dex-services repository, and acquire the project requirements:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gnosis/dex-services.git
```


Once comfortable you're all set, the open solver can be adapted to suit your own needs from the [open solver repository](https://github.com/gnosis/dex-open-solver).

## Building the Driver

Build the driver (with the open solver Docker Hub image) from within the root directory of `dex-services` repo. This command builds the driver while simultanesouly baking the open solver into the the build.

```sh
docker-compose build --build-arg SOLVER_BASE=gnosispm/dex-open-solver:master stablex-debug
```

Be aware, your Docker installation may require elevated privileges!

Note that, if `SOLVER_BASE` is not specified, the driver's own internal `NaiveSolver` will be used. Alternatively, if you have your own personalized solver, this image would need to be specified during the build.

## Configuring Environment Variables

The following three environment variables are _required_ when running the dex-services project. Note that the account corresponding to the private key should be funded with sufficient ETH to pay gas for solution submission.

```sh
export INFURA_KEY=<your infura key>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<your private key>
export NODE_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_KEY}
```

By placing these values into an `.env` file and sourcing this file, you can avoid providing them as runtime arguments on every execution.

## Acquiring the Order book

It can take a very long time for the driver to load the order book, and this process is also restricted by Infura rate limits. For this reason, it's best to supply an existing order book file, which is available for download at:

- [Mainnet](https://gnosis-dfusion-volume-mainnet.s3.amazonaws.com/stablex_orderbook_mainnet.bin)
- [Rinkeby](https://gnosis-dfusion-volume-rinkeby.s3.amazonaws.com/stablex_orderbook_rinkeby.bin)

Copy this orderbook file into `dex-services/target` and append `ORDERBOOK_FILE=/app/dex-services/target/stablex_orderbook_mainnet.bin` to your `.env` file from the previous section. Technically, the orderbook file can be saved anywhere, but we have chosen `target` here since it is flagged as an untracked directory in the project's `.gitignore`.

## Run the Solver

First run and enter the solver container:

```sh
docker-compose run -v $PWD/:/app/dex-services stablex-debug
```

Since the project was mounted inside the container, changes you make to the driver code will be directly reflected on every restart.

The driver can now be run from within the Docker container using the command:

```sh
cargo run --bin driver -- --solver-type OpenSolver --node-url $NODE_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --orderbook-file $ORDERBOOK_FILE
```

or, equivalently, for the simplest and most robust experience, first source your configuration file, and then run the driver without any additional runtime arguments. That is, from within the Docker container:

```sh
source .env_rinkeby
cargo run --bin driver
```

in which `.env_rinkeby` contains the following, minimal, parameters:

```
export INFURA_KEY=<your infura key>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<your private key>
export NODE_URL=https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_KEY}

export SOLVER_TYPE=OpenSolver
export ORDERBOOK_FILE=/app/dex-services/target/stablex_orderbook_rinkeby.bin
```

Observe that the `INFURA_KEY` must also be specified beforehand for the `NODE_URL` to be valid.
Furthermore, while `ORDERBOOK_FILE` is technically an optional argument, it is **not recommended** to run without.

A successfully running and properly configured driver should appear with the following logs:

```

You may also encounter several price estimation warnings, but the driver will recover from this.

```

```

To silence these warnings and for an overall cleaner logging experience, you may also want to add the following log argument:

```sh
 --log-filter warn,driver=info,services_core=info,services_core::price_estimation::clients::generic_client=error
```

or append this as `LOG_FILTER` to your `.env` file.
